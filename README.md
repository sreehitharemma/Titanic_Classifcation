# Titanic_Classifcation
The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for
ships.
The goal of the project was to predict the survival of passengers based off a set of data.
The historical data has been split into two groups, a 'training set' and a 'test set'. For the training set, we are provided with the outcome
(whether or not a passenger survived). We used this set to build our model to generate predictions for the test set
